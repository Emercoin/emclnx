This is JS-layer over the user_page.php.

Experimental and raw code.

Common idea - to protect links to lnx_ref from robot clicks, using generate these links over JS.

Mechanism:

1. html-page reclama.html contains examples of ads show forms, and inclides JS-header (reclama.js).
Each form calls load() function, which fetch URL from reclama.php (unchanged copy of demo user_page.php), 
and insert into current web-page.
